        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>In JavaScript, to declare a variable, we use the var keyword. After the var keyword, we give the variable a name. This name must be unique because it is how we will reference the information stored in the variable in our code.Finally, we use an assignment operator = to assign the specific data that we want stored in our variable.</li>
          <li></li>
          <li>Boolean represents a logical entity and can have two values: true and false.</li>
          <li>The Null type has exactly one value: null(The intentional absence of any object value).</li>
          <li>A variable that has not been assigned a value has the value undefined.</li>
          <li>You can check if a number is within the range of safe integers using (Number.isSafeInteger(.))</li>
          <li>JavaScript's String type is used to represent textual data. It is a set of "elements" of 16-bit unsigned integer values. Each element in the String occupies a position in the String. The first element is at index 0, the next at index 1, and so on. The length of a String is the number of elements in it</li>
          <li>JavaScript strings are immutable. This means that once a string is created, it is not possible to modify it.</li>
          <li>NaN ("Not a Number") is typically encountered when the result of an arithmetic operation cannot be expressed as a number. It is also the only value in JavaScript that is not equal to itself.</li>
          <li>The Number type is a double-precision 64-bit binary format IEEE 754 value. It is capable of storing positive floating-point numbers between 2^-1074 (Number.MIN_VALUE) and 2^1024 (Number.MAX_VALUE) as well as negative floating-point numbers between -(2^-1074) and -(2^1024), but it can only safely store integers in the range -(2^53 − 1) (Number.MIN_SAFE_INTEGER) to 2^53 − 1 (Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER).</li>
          <li>The BigInt type is a numeric primitive in JavaScript that can represent integers with arbitrary precision. With BigInts, you can safely store and operate on large integers even beyond the safe integer limit for Numbers.
              A BigInt is created by appending n to the end of an integer or by calling the constructor.</li>
          <li>A Symbol is a unique and immutable primitive value and may be used as the key of an Object property (see below). In some programming languages, Symbols are called "atoms".</li>
          <li>In computer science, an object is a value in memory which is possibly referenced by an identifier.</li>
          <li>The strict equality operator (===) checks to see if two values are equal, and returns a Boolean result True if the values are equal and false if the values are not equal.</li>
          <li>To comment out multiple lines of JavaScript code, put /* before and */ after the block of code.</li>
          <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
